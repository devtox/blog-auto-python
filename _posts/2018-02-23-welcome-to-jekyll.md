Because it’s awesome. It’s a language with a wide range of uses and you can do so much with it. If you’re interested in using it for prototyping, building out APIs, or stand alone applications, come find out more about it. Python is an open-source programming language that can be used for all kinds of applications. 

It was designed to be accessible to new programmers, and its syntax is highly readable. The name “Python” comes from the British comedy group Monty Python. In 1980, the group released a film called “The Life of Brian” which contained the following sketch about making a computer game. 

Python is expressive, powerful and a joy to read. It has a standard library and an enormous collection of packages. You can use it for nearly every problem you’ll ever encounter. It’s dynamically typed and garbage-collected (i.e. it doesn’t require a lot of repetitive bookkeeping). As such, the learning curve is fairly gentle.
