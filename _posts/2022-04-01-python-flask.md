  Python Flask is a Python package for developing web applications with. It
  features a built-in development server and a unit test integration. Python
  Flask is used in many large projects.


  The Python Flask framework allows you to focus mainly on your business logic, with the user interface being automatically generated from templates.


  Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Flask is an open source web application framework written in Python. Itâ€™s used to create web application prototypes quickly without the need to hook into a specific database or to write raw SQL queries, but you have the option to do so.


  The goal of the project is to empower developers with a simple but flexible structure for application development. Features include, but are not limited to:


  * Routing

  * View Templates

  * Configurations

  * OAuth 1.0a

  * Form Validation

  * Extensions



  ### Flask web app


  We will use Python Flask to create a very simple web application.


  This application will have a single page with a small form that will allow us to track visitors to this page.


  We will perform the following tasks:


  1. Install a recent version of Python and pip.

  2. Install the required Python modules.

  3. Create a new project folder (directory).

  4. Create a new Pyhton file inside our project directory.

  5. Write the first lines of code in our Python file to create a web server.

  6. Test if our web server works correctly by visiting it through our browser.

  7. Configure our web server to respond to HTTP requests (GET and POST methods).

  8. Write the code to process requests (visits) to our web server and save the data in a file in our system.
