PyQt is a set of Python bindings for The Qt cross-platform GUI toolkit. These bindings allow Python programmers to create GUI applications that run on Windows, MacOS X and Linux.

PyQt applications look and feel like native, but with all the power of the full Qt library available at their fingertips.

**What can you do with PyQt?**

Create sophisticated *graphical user interfaces* with Python. 

Use Qt's signal/slot mechanisms or Python's own full-featured OO system to connect your functions to GUI events.

**How do I start?**

This workshop will walk you through the basics of how to create and deploy a GUI application with Python and PyQt. 

We'll cover getting an environment set up, learning about widgets, and what you need to know about events.
