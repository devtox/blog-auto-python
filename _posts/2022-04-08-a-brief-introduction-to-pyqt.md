  using Qt's C++ API. It supports all major desktop platforms.

PyQt provides the Python bindings for Qt, a powerful cross-platform application and UI framework. This allows you to write Python GUI applications that will run on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux/X11, and others with little or no change in the code.

**What can you do with PyQt?**

Create sophisticated *graphical user interfaces* with Python. 

Use Qt's signal/slot mechanisms or Python's own full-featured OO system to connect your functions to GUI events.

**How do I start?**

This workshop will walk you through the basics of how to create and deploy a GUI application with Python and PyQt. We'll cover getting an environment set up, learning about widgets, and what you need to know about events.
